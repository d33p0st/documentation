# {{ page.title }}

`modstore` brings the speed python lacked while implementing complex data structures. Leveraging `Rust's` speed, `modstore` brings custom data structures to decrease processing time. Apart from that, `modstore` offers upgraded built-in data structures such as `list`, `dict`, `tuple` and a few new ones like `stack`.

`modstore` started as a data structure library but now also contains algorithms such as sorting and searching.

- [Rust powered data structures](./rust/#libraries "Rust Index Page (modstore)")

  `modstore` offers the following `rust` powered data structures:

  - [BlockChain](./rust#blockchain/#libraries): Using Rust's performance, create tamper proof blockchain data structure of your required difficulty. Search through the blockchain and retrieve data in their original form as provided.

  - [DAG](./rust#dag/#libraries): Directed Acyclic Graphs are graphs with no cycles, used in certain blockchain variants like [IOTA](https://www.iota.org "IOTA Homepage"). Create, manipulate and store Network like data in DAG ledgers.

- [Upgraded Python built-ins](./builtins/#libraries)

  `modstore` has these upgraded built-ins:

  - [List]

- [New Python data structures](./new/#libraries)

  - [Stack]
  - [HashMap]
